Estas manifestações estão associadas a uma importante interação social entre os homens que denominamos poder.\r\nO poder é toda a probabilidade de impor a própria vontade numa interação social, mesmo contra resistências. Ou seja, o poder presume uma ideia de potencial, podendo existir e não ser exercido. Trazendo esse conceito para o ambiente das organizações, o poder está inteiramente ligado a hierarquia. Os chefes e líderes precisam exercer o poder sob seus funcionários. Porém, existem várias formas diferentes de exercer esse poder hierárquico. Existem gestores que conseguem comandar os subordinados inspirando respeito e fazendo com que eles o obedeçam não apenas pela diferença hierárquica mas pelo respeito e confiança que o líder passa para os funcionários. E existem gestores que abusam do poder hierárquico, pressionando demais os colaboradores, explorando os funcionários, e comportamentos assim podem influenciar negativamente no andamento das atividades da organização, deixando os funcionários desmotivados em trabalhar naquele ambiente.
